## 📝 Description

Pikachu Maze Adventure is a 2D game developed using the so_long framework from the 42 Network. The game starts with Pikachu as the main character, navigating through a labyrinth to collect all the Pokéballs before reaching the exit. The game has two versions:

Basic Version: No enemies—Pikachu can freely collect the Pokéballs and reach the exit.

Extended Version: Introduces enemies that move in a defined pattern. If Pikachu touches an enemy, the game is over, making the gameplay more challenging and competitive.
